# Next.js Starter Project

This is a Next.js project for visualizing and simulating Finite Automata (DFA and NFA).

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.18 or later) installed.

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start by exploring the examples or defining your own automaton in `src/components/automaton-definition-form.tsx`.
